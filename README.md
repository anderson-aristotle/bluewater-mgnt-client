## Planning, process, and problem-solving strategies
1. Planned page layout via wireframe.
2. Discussed user interface buttons and forms.
3. Mapped HTML elements with eventlisteners to control user experience.
4. Linked the backend api with the front-end browser.

## Future Goal(s)
In future iterations, we would like to add some animation, especially in the
bucket list title. Ideally, we'd also spend more time on styling as well; we
used Bootstrap templates, and customized them just enough for MVP.

Integrate with a 3rd location-based API:
  - Allows a user to search for a location or venue to add to their bucket list items.
  - Autofill input field.
  - Drop pins on a map.
  - Add social features to site, such as chat boxes.
  - Allow users to make certain list items public, but default to private.
  - Allow users to upload an image when they complete an item.
